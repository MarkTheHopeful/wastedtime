    <p>Damn, would you look at that, I finally found this site, five years later after its last update</p>
    
    <p>Welp, guess it's time to change things a little here, isn't it?</p>
    
    <p>Stay (not) tuned, maybe I'll find something, including concrete purpose for this site's existence </p>
    
    <p>
    Okay, it's not like anyone is going to read that, so, a list: 
    </p>
    <ol> 
      <li> <s>Make this list a proper list</s> </li>
      <li> <s>Add line breaks to this page</s> </li>
      <li> <s>Write list of ideas and reasons for this site</s> </li>
      <li> <s>Find out why am I not supposed to use &lt;s&gt; for strikethrough</s> </li>
      <li> <s>Find out how to do escaping in HTML</s> </li>
      <li> <s>Create a proper git repo for this site</s> </li>
      <li> Switch to a proper editor instead on plain Vim (or use plugins...) </li>
      <li> Make automatic deployment from github to Neocities?.. </li>
      <li> Make a separate page for "things-I-found" </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    Here it is, the list of ideas for what this site can become/reasons for me to have this site
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li> Personal blog in a non-linear form (hooray, links!)</li>
      <li> Just a public presentation of what I am and what do I like (shrines, about me, etc)</li>
      <li> Things I found interesting/useful and want to share (Crocker's rules?) </li>
      <li> Experiments with low-resource web experience and HTML/CSS/JS(limited) in general </li>
      <li> Moving away from currently traditional internet? </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
    The source code for this site can be found at <a href=https://github.com/MarkTheHopeful/wastedtime>its github repo</a>, free to use/re-use/adapt/whatever, I put GNU GPL 3.0 for the license, so whatever that implies
    </p>

    <h2> Facts/Info I found while working on this site: </h2>
    <h3> About &lt;s&gt;, &lt;del&gt; and such, when to use which </h3>
    <p>
    Okay, apparently there has been an HTML standartization at some point (yet another?), and this time it is about semantic meaning for tags used. 
    </p>
    <p>
    If I understood correctly, now tags have intended 'meaning' behind them, instead of being purely presentational. Therefore:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> If you wanted to show that "...contents are no longer accurate or no longer relevant", usage of &lt;s&gt; is advised </li> 
      <li> However, if you wanted to show that a part of text was simply removed, then one should use the &lt;del&gt; </li> 
      <li> And if you wanted to simply decorate something with a strikethrough line, then you should use CSS?.. Not sure about that. </li>
    </ul>
